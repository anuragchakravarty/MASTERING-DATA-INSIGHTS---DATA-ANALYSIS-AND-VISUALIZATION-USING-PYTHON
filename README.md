# Mastering Data Insights - Data Analysis and Visualization Using Python
Welcome to the "Mastering Data Insights" repository. This repository contains a comprehensive collection of assignments from my summer term classes, focused on data analysis and visualization using Python. 

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Techniques for handling missing data, outliers, and data transformation.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Methods for summarizing the main characteristics of data, often with visual methods.
3. Data Visualization: Creating insightful visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
4. Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical methods to analyze data and draw meaningful conclusions.
5. Machine Learning Basics: Introduction to basic machine learning concepts and algorithms.
6. Project Work: Integration of multiple concepts in comprehensive project assignments.

Here are the following projects included in this repository:

## [Assignment - 1](https://github.com/anuragchakravarty/Mastering-Data-Insights---Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Using-Python/blob/main/assignment_1__summer_class.ipynb)

## [Assignment - 2](https://github.com/anuragchakravarty/Mastering-Data-Insights---Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Using-Python/blob/main/assignment_2__summer_class.ipynb)

## [Assignment - 3](https://github.com/anuragchakravarty/Mastering-Data-Insights---Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Using-Python/blob/main/assignment_3__summer_class.ipynb)
For this assignment, I utilized various datasets that I downloaded from Kaggle.
1. [Stock Data]()
2. [Super_Market Sales](https://github.com/anuragchakravarty/Mastering-Data-Insights---Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Using-Python/blob/main/supermarket_sales.csv)
